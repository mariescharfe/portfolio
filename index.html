hello: Bonjour!

intro: >
  I'm Marie, I focus on branding and logo design. I enjoy creating and embellishing things, whether they're brand new or simply in need of a spruce up! I guess designing fulfills this inexplicable need of mines to fuss and focus on a specific task until it resembles something close to perfection. Go ahead, send me a message and we can discuss what I can obsess over next!
