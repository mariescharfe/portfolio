  FRENCH In a group of 3, in which I was the project lead, I guided the team as we came over challenges and found solutions while developping brand identity and logo for Simple Split. Simple Split is an app that helps parents, cohabitors, and partners living together manage their finances, track and share expenses, store receipts and print annual report for taxes.

  We created a logo, brand guidelines and a SASS website prototype for the app. The fonts and colours chosen helped create a soft and simple identity.

  With proper and extensive research, we were able to create a unified brand for Simple Split. Throughout this process I developped leadership and communication skills.
