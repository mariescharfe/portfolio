  In a group of 3, in which I was the project lead, I guided the team as we came over challenges and found solutions while developing a brand identity and logo for Simple Split. Simple Split is an app that helps parents, cohabitors, and partners living together manage their finances, track and share expenses, store receipts and print annual report for income taxes.

  We created a logo, brand guidelines and a SASS website prototype for the app. The fonts and colours chosen helped create a the perfect identity for Simple Split. It was important that the design reflected simplicity and accuracy.
