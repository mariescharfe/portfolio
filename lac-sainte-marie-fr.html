  FRENCH   Tasked with creating a new logo for a company of my choice, I took on a municipality located close to where I grew up. The original logo had strong elements, which accurately represented it, however it was in need of a little modernization.

  The design process involved creating numerous logo sketches. I went through over 50 versions of the logo, in order to create one that would serve the municipality justice. After having created an initial round of concepts, I pushed it further and went through numerously more iterations in order, to refine and perfect the strongest ones.

  The municipality of Lac-Sainte-Marie is renowned for its ski center, professional golf course, and beautiful scenery composed of great mountains and numerous lakes. These were elements I wanted to try to incorporate within the logo design.

  I ended up staying true to certain elements from the original logo, including the mountains and lakes. These elements represent that which the municipality has to offer. It will encourage both tourtists and locals alike to explore its unique and breathtaking attractions.
