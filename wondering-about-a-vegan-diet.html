title: Wondering About a Vegan Diet?
description: >
  Tasked with creating an infographic on a given subject, I used a combination of all my previously learned skills in order to create an informative poster using various graphics. The concept of the poster was to inform people on the benefits and alternative foods that come with a vegan diet.

  The first part of the projet included sketching various items that will help with understanding the poster. I sketched a variety of different food items and other elements that could potentially be included within the poster.

  Afterwards, I started grouping different items, in order to strategically place them for proper comprehension. Certain aspects held more importance, and therefore needed to be more obviously noticeable at first glance. After having chosen the appropriate hierarchy, I sectioned off different parts of the poster for my different groups of content.

  This assignment turned out rather nicely, however, given the oppurtunity to improve it, I chose to do so. Two years after having created the original infographic, I redesigned it using a lot of the same elements. Overall, it was an interesting study to see what two years difference can make.
