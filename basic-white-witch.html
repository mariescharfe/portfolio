  Tasked with creating an isometric illustration, I quickly started thinking about various concepts I could work on. The only restriction was that the illustration had to show a process. Halloween around the corner and Starbucks coffee in hand, I began to ideate on various concepts revolving around Autumn, and you guessed it... a seasonal favourite: Pumpkin Spice Lattes.

  The concept soon started revolving around Basic White Witches who love their <span class="strike">Pumpkin Spice Lattes</span> Pumpkin Juice. However, the concept needed other elements, in order to create a strong piece. I therefore chose to add in some other Halloween favourites, including the Grim Reaper, zombies, ghosts and vampires.

  Each character had to have their own quirk and identifiable personality. Witches, who run the show, play the roll of the patron. The Grim Reaper holding his traditional scythe, is in charge of cutting and collecting the pumpkins from the pumpkin patch. The zombies are given the brain numbing responsibility of stirring the brew. Ghosts, being incorporeal can't hold their drinks, and the vampire cannot fix his appearance in the mirror, not being reflected within it.

  The final touch was to create a proper branding for <span class="strike">Starbucks</span> Scarebucks. I created a highly recognizable logo, and even the cups mimic their real life counterpart.
